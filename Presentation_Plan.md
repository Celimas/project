# Presentation Plan:

## 7 minutes:

### 2 minutes -- Crash course in the problem I'm solving
 * Image (video?) of on the fly odds during poker games
   * "Alright, so you're watching the world series of poker, and these odds are happening on the fly... But now you're playing! Where are your odds?"
 * Image cascade: Blackjack/Hearthstone/MtG/Go Fish
   * "Ok, so maybe you're not poker players, but you still need to memorize this kind of math. I want to make this easier to memorize."

### 2 minutes -- Demo of my solution
 * I want 2 demos in here
 * Maybe one MtG one and one playing cards one?
 * Make (fake?) pretty output graphs

### 30 seconds -- Closing statements
 * "Hey look! Wasn't that cool?
 * Close with an intro slide (Project name and my name)

### 2.5 minutes -- Questions
 * Pretty self-explanatory
