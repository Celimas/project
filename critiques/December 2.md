I looked at your sample deck like you asked, and most of it seems pretty solid. The only one thing I couldn't quite
figure out from your grammar and semantics is exactly how you determine exactly which traits are needed for each card.
For example, what if you create a trait but it doesn't make sense to have that trait apply to certain cards?
I'm also assuming that you require traits in the order they are defined, except omitted if they are in a foreach
loop instead. That makes sense, but I just want to make sure that I understand correctly.
The traits having to apply to every card in the deck is the only big thing I see, with your grammar seeming pretty
nice and easy to understand. I'll check in once you have the Math stuff up and see if I have more comments.
