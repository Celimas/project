We talked about parsers in Python (your first question) in class, so I'll start with your question about what calculations I would want done. ONe pretty consistent trend that I've seen from watching and playing Hearthstone is the chance of drawing a card by a given turn: what are the chances I get Flamestrike by turn 7 or draw Alexstraza before turn 8?
This connects to some thoughts I've had about the general framework for constructing queries. It seems like you can't possibly predict any possible query, but you can make it much easier to build new ones like you mentioned if you separate the math from the card semantics. So, if you have conditional probability and conjunction built into your language, it will be much easier to add a new type of question that you haven't thought of. This leads to lots of nice, complicated questions people might want to ask that strike me as pretty hard to caclulate on your own, like "given that I have these two cards, what are the chances I draw into my full combo by turn X? What are the chances he has card Y at that point?"
This way, if someone ever comes along and wants to extend your language to include, say, the board and not just draws from a deck, the mathematical syntax for "given this board, what are the chances he plays X and Y by turn Z" become at least a little bit easier. I haven't looked in-depth into the SciPy tools, but I got the feeling that they might be written in a way that lets you define these semi-abstract mathematical concepts well enough to keep the probability calculations separate from the question actually being asked. I think that would be pretty cool.
